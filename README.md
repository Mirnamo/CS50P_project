# CS50P_project
This is CS50P course final project made with python
# Python Games

## Project main purpose:
*the purpose of this program is to rum three different games for the user written in python.*

### Python Project file:
*this file consists of the main code of the project, it contains main method and three game methods which can be chosen by the user to be run.*

***First: main function***
*the main function asks the user about which game he/she likes to play to be able to know which game funtion to run. Inside of the main method after the user selects the game they wish to play, the user is asked again about something relevant to the game function to be passed as a parameter to the selected game function.*

***Second: game1 function***
*Game 1 function is a rock, paper, scissors game that uses a list in which are the three previous choices and randomly assigns a value to a variable that will be later compared to the user's input to determine whether the computer wins or the user.*

***Third: game2 function***
*Game 2 function is a math solving game or better say a multiplication game, where it is determined by three different level that the user chooses from, so level 1 is the easiest, level 2 is the mild one, and level 3 is the hardest. if the user's answer is correct the program congrats the user, if not the program reinplement the user to type the correct answer.*

***Forth: game 3 function***
*Game 3 function is about guessing which animal the prgrame is talking about, so the user will need to read the random printed sentence and think about the answer and type it and then the function will assert the user's answer to the correct answer, so if the answer is correct the user will congratulated, if not the user will have to guess the same one.*

***Fifth: test_project file***
*the test file only purpose is to test whether the three game function are working correctly or not.
I inplemented three test function for the three game function imported from the main file.*
